# 1 with ERD you have already designed on question 1, what database are you using to implement?

Relational database

# 2 Why ->

# Strong point

Structured Data: schema with relationships that can be enforced through foreign keys.

E-commerce platforms typically benefit from ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which are a strong suit of RDBMS.

Join Operations: SQL databases are good at handling JOIN operations, which seem necessary for your ERD due to the relationships between entities like Customers, Products, Carts, and Orders.

Data Integrity: Relational databases enforce data integrity through constraints, which is important for e-commerce data.

# Weak point
