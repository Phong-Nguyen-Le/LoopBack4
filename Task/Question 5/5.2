<!-- Pros: -->

Efficiency: By merging the incoming product data with the existing data in the database, the solution avoids duplicating entries and ensures data consistency.
Data Integrity: Retrieving existing product data from the database allows the system to maintain data integrity and avoid conflicts.
Scalability: The solution can scale well as it relies on database queries to handle large amounts of product data efficiently.
Reliability: The acknowledgement mechanism ensures that the ThirdPartyAPI receives confirmation of successful data receipt, enhancing reliability.

<!-- Cons: -->

Latency: Querying the database and performing data merging operations may introduce latency, especially when dealing with large datasets.
Complexity: Implementing the data merging logic can be complex, especially if dealing with nested or hierarchical data structures.
Dependency on Database: The solution heavily relies on the database for storing and retrieving product data, making it less suitable for scenarios where real-time updates are required.
Potential Data Loss: If not handled properly, the data merging process may lead to data loss or inconsistency if conflicts arise during the merge operation.
